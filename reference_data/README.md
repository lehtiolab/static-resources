## Reference data

At the moment this only contains `human_normal_tissue_mzmls.txt` which is a text file containing a list of ProteomeXchange files (converted to mzML)
from a number of proteomeXchange datasets on healthy human tissues. The files are annotated with their PXD ID, tissue, enzyme, instrument, a format 
specific to the crosscheck pipeline from PGT.
